# HTDF
## Introduction
   HTDF is a high-performance public blockchain developed by YiJaYi Info Tech. Co,LTD. It is based on [ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) & [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) on [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)  . We merged tendermint's consensus, cosmos-sdk's application logic, and ethereum's account system & smart contract architecture into a brand new architecture - htdf blockchain.  This project is now UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.
   
   **Note**: Requires Go 12.9+
